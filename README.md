# RAG-Powered_LogQA
## Overview

This project develops a Question-Answering (Q&A) system that leverages web traffic logs to answer user queries. The system is built on the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model, which retrieves relevant information from traffic logs and generates accurate responses to user questions.

You can use this project with either synthetic log data, generated by the script provided, or your own web traffic logs.

## Key Features

- **Synthetic Log Generation**: A script is provided to generate realistic, diverse web traffic logs using the `Faker` library. The generated logs simulate various user interactions, including geographic locations, IP addresses, HTTP methods, URLs, browser user agents, referrers, and session information.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The Q&A system retrieves relevant information from the log data and generates suitable answers to user queries based on those logs.
