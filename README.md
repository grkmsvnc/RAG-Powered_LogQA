# RAG-Powered_LogQA
## Overview

This project develops a Question-Answering (Q&A) system that leverages web traffic logs to answer user queries. The system is built on the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model, which retrieves relevant information from traffic logs and generates accurate responses to user questions.

You can use this project with either synthetic log data, generated by the script provided, or your own web traffic logs.

## Key Features

- **Synthetic Log Generation**: A script is provided to generate realistic, diverse web traffic logs using the `Faker` library. The generated logs simulate various user interactions, including geographic locations, IP addresses, HTTP methods, URLs, browser user agents, referrers, and session information.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The Q&A system retrieves relevant information from the log data and generates suitable answers to user queries based on those logs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` provided in the repo:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

### 1. Generating Synthetic Web Traffic Logs

If you do not have access to your own web traffic logs, you can generate synthetic logs using the provided script. This script simulates real-world user interactions on a website and generates logs in a format similar to those used by Apache or Nginx servers.

To generate synthetic log data:

```bash

python synthetic_data.py

```

By default, this will generate 10,000 log entries and save them to `diverse_synthetic_web_traffic.log`. You can modify the number of entries as needed by passing a different value to the `num_entries` parameter.

### 2. Using Your Own Log Data

If you already have your own web traffic logs, you can skip the synthetic log generation and proceed directly to using the logs with the Q&A system. Ensure that your logs are formatted correctly (e.g., Apache/Nginx log format) so that they can be properly parsed and analyzed by the system.

### Example Log Entry

Here’s an example of a synthetic log entry generated by the script:

```arduino

192.168.56.12 - 5a1fcf10-e89b-11eb-9a03-0242ac130003 [19/Aug/2023:10:15:32 +0000] "GET /product HTTP/1.1" 200 12345 "https://google.com" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36" Cookie="5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"

```

This log entry includes details like:

- IP Address

2. **Numerical and Categorical Embedding**:
    - Normalizes numerical features (hour, status, request size) and one-hot encodes categorical features (day of the week) to create embeddings for these attributes.
3. **Combining Embeddings**:
    - Merges textual embeddings with numerical and categorical embeddings to form a final representation of each log entry.
4. **FAISS Vector Storage**:
    - Utilizes **FAISS** to store these embeddings, allowing for efficient vector-based similarity searches. This enables fast and scalable retrieval of the most relevant log entries based on user queries.
5. **Querying the FAISS Index**:
    - The script includes an example of how to query the FAISS index using an embedding (e.g., the first log entry) and retrieve the top-k nearest neighbors (log entries).

### How to Use

1. **Prepare the Cleaned Data**:
    - Ensure that you have cleaned log data available in the Excel format (`high_quality_log.xlsx`). This is the input for the embedding creation and storage process.
2. **Run the Embedding and Storage Script**:
    - The script processes the cleaned log data to generate embeddings and stores them in a FAISS index for efficient retrieval.
    
    ```bash
    
    python embedding_vectorstorage.py
    
    ```
    
3. **Check the Output**:
    - After running the script, you will find the following files in your project directory:
        - `final_embeddings.npy`: The final embeddings generated from the log data.
        - `faiss_index.bin`: The FAISS index containing the stored embeddings for efficient retrieval.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Text Feature Extraction and Embedding**:
    - The script extracts key textual features such as URL, referrer, user agent, HTTP method, and timestamp. These features are combined into a single string for each log entry, which is then embedded using a **Sentence-Transformer** model (e.g., `all-mpnet-base-v2`).
2. **Numerical and Categorical Feature Preparation**:
    - Numerical features (hour, status code, request size) are normalized using `StandardScaler`, while the day of the week is one-hot encoded to represent categorical data.
3. **Embedding Combination**:
    - The textual embeddings are combined with the numerical and categorical embeddings to form the final log entry representation. These combined embeddings serve as the input for the FAISS index.
4. **FAISS Index Creation**:
    - The final embeddings are added to a FAISS index using **L2 (Euclidean) distance** for fast similarity search. The FAISS index allows for efficient querying of log entries based on their vector representations.
5. **Querying the FAISS Index**:
    - The script includes an example query using the first log entry's embedding to search for the top 5 nearest neighbors in the FAISS index. It returns the indices and distances of the most similar log entries.

### Example Output:

- **Final Embeddings Shape**: The shape of the final combined embeddings is printed to ensure the correct size of the vector representation.
    
    ```sql
    
    Final embeddings shape: (10000, 768)
    
    ```
    
- **FAISS Index Population**: The total number of vectors added to the FAISS index is printed.
    
    ```css
    
    Total of 10000 vectors added to FAISS.

## Log Querying with Llama3-70B Model and Groq API (llama3_70b_groq.py)

In **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, security is a critical concern, especially when handling sensitive documents and logs related to companies and organizations. Due to these concerns, large language models such as **OpenAI's GPT models**, **Claude**, and **Gemini** have not been used in this system to avoid potential security risks associated with API calls to third-party services. Instead, by leveraging sufficient **GPU resources**, the **Llama3-70B** model can be run **locally**, ensuring full control over data security and eliminating the need to share sensitive information with external providers.

### Why Llama3-70B?

![Ekran Görüntüsü (441)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/076cdf20-3468-459e-8124-fcabcd9a6786)


The **Llama3-70B** model was selected as the best open-source model for this system because of its high performance, achieving a score of **0.95**. Although it tied with **Alibaba's qwen2-72b-instruct**, Llama3-70B was chosen due to qwen2-72b-instruct producing 60% longer responses, which could lead to increased costs and potentially slower response times. Hence, Llama3-70B provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.

### Key Features:

1. **FAISS Index Querying**:
    - The script queries a **FAISS** index to retrieve the closest log entries based on embeddings generated from user queries. The logs are retrieved in vector form, allowing for quick, scalable searches.
2. **Embedding Combination**:
    - The query embeddings are dynamically generated from the user's text input and combined with numerical features (e.g., hour, status, request size) and one-hot encoded categorical data (e.g., day of the week). This ensures that the search is highly contextual and accurate.
3. **Groq API Integration**:
    - The script utilizes the **Groq API** to generate detailed, human-readable responses based on the logs retrieved from FAISS. The response not only addresses the user query but also analyzes the log data to identify trends and issues.
4. **Advanced Model (Llama3-70B)**:
    - **Llama3-70B** is used to generate comprehensive answers, making use of the log data to provide insights and detect problems in the system.

### How to Use

1. **Prepare FAISS Index and Log Data**:
    - Ensure that the FAISS index and cleaned log data are available. The FAISS index should be stored in a file (e.g., `faiss_index.bin`), and the log data should be loaded from an Excel file (`high_quality_log.xlsx`).
2. **Run the Log Query Script**:
    - The script allows users to input a query (e.g., "Are there any errors in the system?"), which is then processed to search the FAISS index and generate a response using **Groq API** and **Llama3-70B**.
    
    ```bash
    bashKodu kopyala
    python llama3_70b_groq.py
    
    ```
    
3. **Check the Output**:
    - After running the script, the system will output the nearest log entries and generate a detailed response to the user query, providing valuable insights into the system’s behavior.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Loading the FAISS Index and Log Data**:
    - The FAISS index is loaded from a file (`faiss_index.bin`), and the log data is read from an Excel file (`high_quality_log.xlsx`).
2. **Query Embedding Creation**:
    - The user query is transformed into a dense vector representation using a **Sentence-Transformer** model. This embedding is combined with numeric and one-hot encoded features (hour, status code, request size, day of the week) to match the FAISS index.
3. **FAISS Search**:
    - The FAISS index is queried to retrieve the closest log entries based on the query embedding. This ensures that the most relevant logs are returned for further analysis.
4. **Groq API Response Generation**:
    - Once the relevant logs are retrieved, the **Groq API** is used to generate a detailed response using the **Llama3-70B** model. The response includes an analysis of the log entries and addresses the user's question directly, identifying potential issues or patterns.
