# RAG-Powered_LogQA
## Overview

This project develops a Question-Answering (Q&A) system that leverages web traffic logs to answer user queries. The system is built on the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model, which retrieves relevant information from traffic logs and generates accurate responses to user questions.

You can use this project with either synthetic log data, generated by the script provided, or your own web traffic logs.

## Key Features

- **Synthetic Log Generation**: A script is provided to generate realistic, diverse web traffic logs using the `Faker` library. The generated logs simulate various user interactions, including geographic locations, IP addresses, HTTP methods, URLs, browser user agents, referrers, and session information.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The Q&A system retrieves relevant information from the log data and generates suitable answers to user queries based on those logs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` provided in the repo:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

### 1. Generating Synthetic Web Traffic Logs

If you do not have access to your own web traffic logs, you can generate synthetic logs using the provided script. This script simulates real-world user interactions on a website and generates logs in a format similar to those used by Apache or Nginx servers.

To generate synthetic log data:

```bash
bashKodu kopyala
python generate_log_file.py

```

By default, this will generate 10,000 log entries and save them to `diverse_synthetic_web_traffic.log`. You can modify the number of entries as needed by passing a different value to the `num_entries` parameter.

### 2. Using Your Own Log Data

If you already have your own web traffic logs, you can skip the synthetic log generation and proceed directly to using the logs with the Q&A system. Ensure that your logs are formatted correctly (e.g., Apache/Nginx log format) so that they can be properly parsed and analyzed by the system.
